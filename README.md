# Link Forge

Welcome to Link Forge, the ultimate 3D strategy showdown! Outsmart the computer in this retro-inspired grid battle where linking spheres is the name of the game. 

## What's the Deal?

- **Grid Action**: Battle it out on a 3x3x3 grid (27 spheres total). Click to claim your spots, and watch the computer fight back!

- **Link to Win**: *Connect 3+ adjacent spheres to score big.* The more you link, the higher your points—strategy is key!

- **Score Multiplier**: Each group racks up points. Chain those links for epic totals!

- **Turn-Based Fun**: Alternate turns with the AI. Highest score at the end wins—tie? We call it a draw!
